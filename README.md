Overview

SmartAd is a mobile first advertiser agency.The finance team of Rossmann wants to forecast sales in all their 
stores across several cities six weeks ahead of time. Managers in individual stores rely on their years of 
experience as well as their personal judgement to forecast sales. The data team identified factors such as 
promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality as necessary for predicting 
the sales across the various stores. The task is to build and serve an end-to-end product that delivers 
this prediction to analysts in the finance team.

A/B Testing 

A/B testing (also known as bucket testing or split-run testing) is a user experience research methodology. A/B tests consist of 
a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B. It includes application of statistical hypothesis testing or "two-sample 
hypothesis testing" as used in the field of statistics. A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable, 
typically by testing a subject's response to variant A against variant B, and determining which of the two variants is 
more effective.In This Project by Using A/B testing to test if the ads that the advertising company ran resulted
in a significant boost in brand awareness.
